A command line utility to log the books I'm currently reading and my progress. This is all in a \[vain\] attempt to start actually finishing books on my docket.

I hope to add categories and possibly a completed books list in the future, but as a program solely meant for my personal use, this will suffice for now.

## To run utility:

- Modify filename in utils.cpp to desired file
- Build executable (can be found in "Release" directory)
- Place executable in a PATH directory
- Run by typing "atticus" into cmd

### Happy Reading!
